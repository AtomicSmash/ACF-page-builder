# ACF - Page builder prototype

This is a prototype plugin that modifies Advanced Custom Field's Flexible Content admin interface.

This plugin injects some CSS + JS to modify the way sub flexible content fields are displayed within other flexible content fields. This allows you to use ACF like a page builder: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c_Xa0gKWu4.
